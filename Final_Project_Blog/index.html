                On the rare chance that Amazon doesn’t have what you’re looking for, we – [Insert App Name Here] will be here, waiting to serve. With a great, but admittedly limited selection of products, we believe that everyone can find something to satisfy them in our database of goods.

                On the front-end, we will have a generic page, where people can browse our products, and even add products to the cart. The first thing that the user will see are the most popular items on our site. There will be a search bar that the user will be able to use to find specific items at their request. As well, the navigation bar will allow the user to search through product categories, not unlike some of the biggest retail giants out there. The user may also add items of their choosing to a shopping cart and select the quantity for each item. The price will update without refresh on insertion and deletion of these items. Local storage could also be used to save shopping cart items and or even recommend items from the user’s search history.
                
                On the back-end, we will store all of our product information in MongoDB, and make frequent calls to the database that will include product description, and image of the product, etc. As the user navigates our site, they will query for more product information from the database, and it will update immediately, in most cases without reloading the page.

                We will be using React as out view engine.
