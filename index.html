        <h3>Preparing For The Trip</h3>
        <p class='mb-0'>
            Make sure you inform your credit card company you are traveling to a foreign country so your cards don't get declined. Know the currency of foreign countries you visit so you don't get scammed. Get a phone plan that works for you over seas. Financial aid and scholarships can help a lot of students afford to travel abroad who never thought they could. Make sure you have money saved up and set a budget for however much you are willing to spend. Make sure not to overpack on clothes and needless luggage. You will almost indefinitely buy a rediculas amount of stuff to take back so underpacking is much better than overpacking. Your passport is your lifeline when traveling overseas guard it with your life and never lose sight of it.

        <h3>Studying</h3>
        <p>
            When studying abroad I would recommend taking electives. If you take too difficult of courses you will be parched for time and regret your decision. Make sure to get your homework done as soon as possible because you won't want to do them on the weekends while you might be traveling. Most people choose to take electives while studying abroad.

        <h3>Making friends (Super Important)</h3>
        <p> 
            Making friends is extremely easy while studying abroad. No one wants to travel alone. Almost everyone travels in groups because it is easier and a lot cheaper. What was peculiar to me was that; I felt like I knew these people for years even though if was only 6 weeks. Also making friends with locals will improve your experience tremendiously. They can show you around and communicate for you if you are unfamiliar with the language. While I was staying in innsbruck everyone was assigned an buddy who was from Innsbruck, Austria. I had a buddy named Thomas.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
             Traveling abroad is something that everyone should atleast look into. I had a wonderful experience studying abroad and think that it is commonly overlooked.
