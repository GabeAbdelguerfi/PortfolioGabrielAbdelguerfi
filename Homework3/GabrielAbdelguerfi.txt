Shopping Cart
I implemented a shopping cart app in which the user can choose to add multiple items
 to the shopping cart. The user can then select the quantity for each of the items. 
 As the user selects items and changes there quantities the users total (price of their product) will automatically update. 
 The user can also remove items from their shopping cart. The user can not enter NAN values for their quantity or try to use 
 the down arrow to enter a negative quantity the number will automatically reset to 1 if they do so. You will get a popup message 
 if you try to add the same item to the cart multiple times. When you refresh the screen you will get a empty shopping cart but the
 data from the previous shopping cart will be stores in the local storage api.
